Second assignment for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree Program. 
In this project, a memory game was created with 16 cards of 8 different images. 
The goal was to match two equal cards, have them stay open, and to continue this way until all cards have been matched together 
or until the user runs out of tries. Made with HTML, CSS and JQuery.
